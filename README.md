### Simulating the Emergence of Dependency Length Minimization Preferences

##### The implementation is based on the [NeLLCom](https://github.com/Yuchen-Lian/NeLLCom) framework and [EGG](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG) toolkit.
##### Portions of this ongoing work have been published as [Endowing Neural Language Learners with Human-like Biases: A Case Study on Dependency Length Minimization](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.516/) at LREC-COLING 2024 and presented as [Neural-agent Language Learning and Communication: Emergence of Dependency Length Minimization](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7fr1b90k) at CogSci 2024.

##### Since we are currently expanding the experiments with many factors added and tested, the repository will be updated after the extended journal is peer-reviewed. If you are interested in the details, feel free to contact me!
